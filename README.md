# Team challenge on Bootstrap.
  
## Mission
Our **mission** is to realise a window web page for a restaurant. The franchise is fictive, but we get to choose the type of food (burger, pizza, asian, ...).
The website must be responsive, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

- **Welcome** : A page with one Jumbotron and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc...).
- **Menu** : A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.
- **Pictures** : A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).
- **Contact** : A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.

## Instructions 
- Don't use a pre-made theme
- Write a good README
- Use SASS
- Responsive
- Use ONLY royalty-free pictures AND credit in your readme the website where the pictures are from
